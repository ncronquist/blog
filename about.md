Welcome to my tech blog! I started this blog as a way for me to become a better developer. I found that when I write about a topic, I end up thinking about it much more in-depth and I actually take the time to research the parts that I don't understand. Obviously, I could just write for myself and not force my terrible prose upon the world, but I am hoping that the information I write will at least be useful if not pretty.

If you have any suggestions, criticisms, or questions, please feel free to email me at nick@ncronquist.com.
